# Task Manager App By Mohammad Al Bali

### Description
The Task Manager App is a robust and feature-rich application built using **Flutter**.
It enables users to manage tasks efficiently with functionalities like authentication, task CRUD operations, pagination, and state management.
The app is designed following Flutter best practices, with a focus on performance, clean code, and intuitive user experience following **Google Material 3 Design Rules**.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure login using `https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth`.
   - Validates username and password and fetches user details based on the authentication token.

2. **Task Management**
   - Add, view, edit, and delete tasks.
   - User-specific task management with distinct endpoints for personal and global tasks.

3. **Pagination**
   - Efficient task retrieval using paginated APIs (`https://dummyjson.com/todos?limit=30&skip=30`).
   - Lazy Loading by listening to screen scrolls to effectively fetch more data

4. **State Management**
   - Implemented using **BLoC** for efficient and scalable application state handling.

5. **Local Storage**
   - Tasks are stored persistently using **SQFLite** for local data availability.
   - Settings like themes, language preferences and tokens are managed via **SharedPreferences**.

6. **Localization**
   - Multi-language support for English and Arabic, seamlessly switchable in-app without the need to restart.

7. **Light & Dark Mode**
   - Dynamically toggles between light and dark themes to enhance user experience.

8. **Unit Testing**
   - Comprehensive test coverage for task CRUD operations, input validation, and state management using mocks.

9. **Show Case View**
   - Tutorials on first startup, improving user usability
